PCFs are the greenhouse gas emissions attributable to a given product, measured in CO<sub>2</sub> (carbon dioxide equivalent).\n\nThis data is stored in a PostgreSQL database containing one table, `product_emissions`, which looks at PCFs by product as well as the stage of production that these emissions occurred. Here's a snapshot of what `product_emissions` contains in each column:\n\n### `product_emissions`\n\n| field                              | data type |\n|------------------------------------|-----------|\n| `id`                                 | `VARCHAR`   |\n| `year`                               | `INT`       |\n| `product_name`                       | `VARCHAR`   |\n| `company`                            | `VARCHAR`   |\n| `country`                            | `VARCHAR`   |\n| `industry_group`                     | `VARCHAR`   |\n| `weight_kg`                          | `NUMERIC`   |\n| `carbon_footprint_pcf`               | `NUMERIC`   |\n| `upstream_percent_total_pcf`         | `VARCHAR`   |\n| `operations_percent_total_pcf`       | `VARCHAR`   |\n| `downstream_percent_total_pcf`       | `VARCHAR`   |\n\nYou'll use this data to examine the carbon footprint of each industry in the dataset!

The results should be sorted by total_industry_footprint from highest to lowest **values.**","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"61cbeaa7-10de-4176-b2cf-065689a37175"},{"source":"-- Find the most recent date \nSELECT MAX(year)\nFROM product_emissions;\n\n-- Complete the query\nSELECT industry_group,\n\tCOUNT(DISTINCT company) AS num_companies,\n\tROUND(SUM(carbon_footprint_pcf), 1) AS total_industry_footprint\nFROM product_emissions\nWHERE year IN (SELECT MAX(year) FROM product_emissions)\nGROUP BY industry_group\nORDER BY total_industry_footprint DESC;","metadata":{"customType":"sql","dataFrameVariableName":"df","sqlCellMode":"dataFrame","sqlSource":{"integrationId":"89e17161-a224-4a8a-846b-0adc0fe7a4b1","type":"integration"},"executionCancelledAt":null,"executionTime":984,"lastExecutedAt":1732212881855,"lastExecutedByKernel":"a8365e81-e617-42a2-ba16-0770cfd15ece","lastScheduledRunId":null,"lastSuccessfullyExecutedCode":"-- Find the most recent date \nSELECT MAX(year)\nFROM product_emissions;\n\n-- Complete the query\nSELECT industry_group,\n\tCOUNT(DISTINCT company) AS num_companies,\n\tROUND(SUM(carbon_footprint_pcf), 1) AS total_industry_footprint\nFROM product_emissions\nWHERE year IN (SELECT MAX(year) FROM product_emissions)\nGROUP BY industry_group\nORDER BY total_industry_footprint DESC;","outputsMetadata":{"0":{"height":277,"type":"dataFrame"}}},"cell_type":"code","id":"6a55dbd4-6d78-4116-b2a8-6f73c1ef87eb","outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"application/com.datacamp.data-table.v2+json":{"table":{"schema":{"fields":[{"name":"index","type":"integer"},{"name":"industry_group","type":"string"},{"name":"num_companies","type":"integer"},{"name":"total_industry_footprint","type":"number"}],"primaryKey":["index"],"pandas_version":"1.4.0"},"data":{"index":[0,1,2,3,4,5],"industry_group":["Materials","Capital Goods","Technology Hardware & Equipment","Food, Beverage & Tobacco","Commercial & Professional Services","Software & Services"],"num_companies":[3,2,4,1,1,1],"total_industry_footprint":[107129,94942.7,21865.1,3161.5,740.6,690]}},"total_rows":6,"truncation_type":null},"text/plain":"                       industry_group  num_companies  total_industry_footprint\n0                           Materials              3                  107129.0\n1                       Capital Goods              2                   94942.7\n2     Technology Hardware & Equipment              4                   21865.1\n3            Food, Beverage & Tobacco              1                    3161.5\n4  Commercial & Professional Services              1                     740.6\n5                 Software & Services              1                     690.0","text/html":"<div>\n<style scoped>\n    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n        vertical-align: middle;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n        vertical-align: top;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe thead th {\n        text-align: right;\n    }\n</style>\n<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n      <th></th>\n      <th>industry_group</th>\n      <th>num_companies</th>\n      <th>total_industry_footprint</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <th>0</th>\n      <td>Materials</td>\n      <td>3</td>\n      <td>107129.0</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>1</th>\n      <td>Capital Goods</td>\n      <td>2</td>\n      <td>94942.7</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>2</th>\n      <td>Technology Hardware &amp; Equipment</td>\n      <td>4</td>\n      <td>21865.1</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>3</th>\n      <td>Food, Beverage &amp; Tobacco</td>\n      <td>1</td>\n      <td>3161.5</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>4</th>\n      <td>Commercial &amp; Professional Services</td>\n      <td>1</td>\n      <td>740.6</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>5</th>\n      <td>Software &amp; Services</td>\n      <td>1</td>\n      <td>690.0</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n</div>"},"metadata":{},"execution_count":49,"@datacamp/metadata":{"executedQuery":"-- Find the most recent date \nSELECT MAX(year)\nFROM product_emissions;\n\n-- Complete the query\nSELECT industry_group,\n\tCOUNT(DISTINCT company) AS num_companies,\n\tROUND(SUM(carbon_footprint_pcf), 1) AS total_industry_footprint\nFROM product_emissions\nWHERE year IN (SELECT MAX(year) FROM product_emissions)\nGROUP BY industry_group\nORDER BY total_industry_footprint DESC;","executedQueryParameters":[]}}],"execution_count":49}],"metadata":{"colab":{"name":"Welcome to DataCamp Workspaces.ipynb","provenance":[]},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3 (ipykernel)","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.8.10"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
